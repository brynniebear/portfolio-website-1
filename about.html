                <h2>My name is Brynn Williams. I was born in Saskatoon, SK.</h2>
                <p>
                I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Calgary, earning a BA in Dance and the Faculty of Arts' Silver Medallion in Dance. After living and teaching in Thailand for a brief five months, I moved to Vancouver where I earned a MA in Human Development, Learning, and Culture. I currently live and work in the beautiful city of Vancouver.
                </p>
                <p>
                I thrive in situations and with projects that require creation, adaptability, and learning. I love to learn new skills, especially when I can apply that knowledge to create something new or solve a problem.
                </p>
                <p>    
                My love of learning has drawn me to different fields throughout my life: dance, education, language, wellness, writing, and web development, to name a few. From each of these areas, I carry forward new experiences, skills, and knowledge that help me to thrive in my next chosen environment.

                    <h2>I am a creator, a learner, and a teacher.</h2>
                    <p>
                    From crawling onto my parents' bed to "read" picture books to myself as a toddler, to building endless creations out of lego as I grew older, to dancing my way through an undergraduate degree, to teaching in Canada and abroad, I have always been drawn to creative and educational persuits.                
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Front-end development is no exception.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I first came to coding because I was thinking about pursuing a degree in eduation technology, with a practical component. I jumped into the magic of development and then got lost in the endless possibilities for creation and the allure of an industry steeped in continuous learning, not to mention the friends, mentors, and collaborators I met along the way.
