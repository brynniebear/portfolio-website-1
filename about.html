                <h2>My name is Brynn Williams, and I was born in Saskatoon, Sk.</h2>
                <p>
                    I help small businesses develop an online presence and reach their clientele through thoughtful and responsive website development.

                    As an educator interested in communication and knowledge translation, I am passionate about creating websites and projects that are functional and friendly for everyone. I am keenly interested in bringing others' visions to life and collaborating with my clients to help them reach their goals.
                    
                    I thrive in situations and with projects that require creation, adaptability, and learning. I love to learn new skills, especially when I can apply that knowledge to create something new or solve a problem.
                    
                    My love of learning has drawn me to different fields throughout my life: dance, education, language, wellness, writing, and web development, to name a few. From each of these areas, I carry forward new experiences, skills, and knowledge that help me to thrive in my next chosen environment.
