                    <p><strong>HTML - CSS </strong></p>
                    <p>
                    This project had two main goals: to learn how to develop responsive websites and applications and to showcase my development work to potential employers or collaborators. Take a look around and tell me what you think!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    My website is built mainly using HTML and CSS, with Bootstrap, Google Fonts, and FontAwesome to support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    While creating this website, I had a ton of fun messing around with CSS, learning about media queries, and using Bootstrap grids and utility classes to showcase my work.

                    <p><strong>React - HTML - CSS - JS - API</strong></p>
                    <p>This weather app was inspired by my love of plants and my dive into learning React.</p>
                    <p>
                    It was created using React, HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, and Open Weather API.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    While creating this app, I fell in love with the possibilities React presents for creating fluid and functional user interfaces, as well as organizing code into easy-to-manage chunks.

                    <p>
                    My focus for this app was to use my understanding of React to create a second application from scratch. I chose a simple design and focused on functionality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This dictionary app was created using React, HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, and two APIs (Pexels and Free Dictionary API).

                    <p>
                    My Fair Weather Friend project was a labour of love. It was my first true dive into the world of coding. I went from not knowing JavaScript, how to host a site, or integrate APIs, to a fully functional app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I created this app using HTML, CSS, and JS, as well as Bootstrap and API integration of Open Weather API.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Good ol' Paint helped me create weather puns for different types of weather. Can you find them all?
